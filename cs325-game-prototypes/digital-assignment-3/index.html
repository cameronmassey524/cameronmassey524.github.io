<h2>Your game title</h2>


<ul>

<li><strong>Controls:</strong>
Left/right: Arrow Keys <br />
Z: kick<br />
X: Punch <br />
C: Jump <br />
Aerial kick: Z while mid-air <br />
</li>


<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Rather than the player character being the object of interest, it is a ball which you can hit around with different attacks. Coins are gathered by the ball, and the level is won when the ball reaches the end goal.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Originally I was planning to do by-pixel collision for hitbox animations, so the player sprite coincides with a hitter sprite which provides the hitboxes for each move in red pixels. Unfortunately I did not know enough about phaser to complete this so the hit detection is really broken (dont even know why)
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
From this I learned how to use spritesheets for animation. The hardest part by far is collision/physics. Thats why it still doesnt work. I have underestimated the amount of phaser knowledge i must have mastered to complete this task.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

Hitbox animation is custom, modeled after the character.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A platformer where the ball must be kicked or punched around the level to complete objectives.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
It was supposed to be contemplative, in that you would have to think about when and where you will use each attack to complete the objectives in as few moves as possible, or without letting the ball hit the ground.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I intended to include slight randomness in the trajectory of the ball after being hit, but I could not manage the collisions in time,
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Using hitboxes and player velocity to determine the trajectory of a hit target.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Creative freedom in solving a puzzle, meaning there could be several solutions that could prioritize combo-count (without touching ground), completion time, or fewest hits.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Player can jab, punch, kick, and perform an aerial kick. Each attack sends the ball at a different trajectory and velocity. Jump kick velocity is dependannt on player velocity as well.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Use weak moves to bounce the ball in to a position where you can hit it strongly in a more useful direction.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anybody who like puzzle platformers, fighting games, and/or speedrunning perhaps.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The play time of a level would largely be determined by the player, as it is up to them to solve the puzzle of getting the ball from start to finish using their characters moveset.
