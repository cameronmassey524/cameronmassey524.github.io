<h2>N!</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Notes:</strong> </br>
1. Special Attacking has been saved for iteration. </br>
2. Move selected pieces using W-A-S-D </br>
3. Attacking currently does not expend energy. This is a design choice to be tested. </br>
4. The game currently allows you to select incorrect starting lines. If N=5, your starting line should be any combination of digits 1 through 5.</br>
4.1 	Examples of legal starting lines for n-5: 12345, 54321, 15243, 13245.
</li>

<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
In this board game, the utility of game pieces change as they move across the board. Strategic positioning and movement of these pieces will be rewarded through a special attacking mechanic. You also get to choose the starting location of your pieces along your starting row. A special event happens when two combatant pawns values add to N, which was the chosen board size.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This game takes advantage of its digital form by handling what would be tedious additions and subtractions, 
and keeps a live score count automatically so players can accurately judge their performance/chances. This could
also be used to automate special win conditions that are listed below. The game board and pieces will scale depending on chosen N for board size,
and the gameplay rules apply to all board sizes. However, very small and very large board sizes are not reccomended. The best range is between 6 and 9.
The game also makes use of multiple scene, One for each setup input, and one for the game board.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to make a game where players compete and interact with each other. 
The hardest part was to develop the actual game rules for a player vs. player strategy game.
Physical prototyping was challenging because there are many things which would not be realistic
in a physical board game, but are made much easier by digitalization. At the end i believe I 
created a game that is fun on paper, but much more enjoyable in digital form. I also learned how
to implement game assets of dynamic, player defined scale.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All graphics are geometry. There are no assets.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I think the game resembles a highly simplified chess (not quite as simple as checkers), combined with Blizzard's virtual card game Hearthstone.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A size-scalable board game where the utility of each piece changes as you move them.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Players choose the starting positions of their pieces via double-blind pick, and also choose the board size.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype mainly evaluates dynamic utility across a heirarchy pieces which follow identical rules.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to experience a strategy game where memorizing openenings and move sequences (i.e. chess) is unnecessary. Ones own intuition and game widsom can be more easily applied.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Board: The game board is an NxN grid. Each player has 1 row of game pieces, numbered 1 through N. Starting positions are on opposite edge rows, and the order of your pieces are chosen via double-blind pick.  N is chosen by the players before starting, and it is arbitrary. </br>
Movement: Pieces move and attack on adjacent squares and can attack on diagonal squares. Each time a piece is moved a square, the value of the piece is decreased by 1, until the turn is over where its value is restored. If you attack after moving extra squares, you will use the decreased value to attack. If an 8 piece moves three spaces, it would be acting as a 5 piece from that point until the end of your turn. Moving again reduces it to a 4 piece, etc. If a piece survives the end of your turn, the movement penalty is reversed. Pieces are eliminated if their value reaches 0 during an attack event.</br>
Turns: Turns end when a player has made N moves in total. They can also decide finish their turn in fewer moves, at any point before they have made N moves. Attacks are also turns, but your piece does not move or take movement penalty an attack is made.</br>
Normal attacks: Upon attack, the numbers subtract from each other. For example, if you attack a 2-piece with your 5-piece, the 2-piece will be eliminated, and the 5-piece becomes a 3 piece. However, if your 5-piece was originally an 8-piece which moved 3 spaces that turn, the difference of 3 will be added back to your piece after you end your turn, as long as your pieces value never reaches 0 on an attack. So for this example, if an 8-piece moved 3 spaces to attack a 2-piece as a 5-piece, the 2 is eliminated, and reduces the 5 to a 3. If the turn stops here, it will regenerate the value of its movement penalty of 3, and become a 6. If the turn continues and the piece reaches 0, it will be eliminated, and the movement penalty will not be restored.</br>
Special attacks: If the sum of the numbers in an attack is equal to N, then the attacking piece does not lose any value, and the targeted piece is eliminated. So, if you are playing with N=9, you can attack a 6-piece with your 3-piece to eliminate the 6 without damaging your 3 piece. If the attacking piece has moved additional spaces, the distance-adjusted piece value is used. So again if N=9, you could move a 9 piece three spaces to attack a 3-piece, and your attacking piece would not be injured. If you ended your turn there, the piece would restore to a value of 9.</br>


Win condition: 
Players win when the opponentâ€™s pieces are eliminated. For quicker games, a player wins when the sum of his piece values are at least double that of his opponents at the end of a turn. It can also be implemented as a mercy rule with larger N games. At any point, a player can forfeit the game. </br>

</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I predict that the most effective general strategy will involve either using your largest pieces aggressively, or using them defensively to protect your weaker pieces as you build a strong position.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
It is a board game so it is relatively abstract: There is no story, setting, premise. Resources which will act as dramatic elements will be the number, position, and values of board pieces. A dramatic game mechanic is the threat/opportunity of special attacks.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is people who enjoy strategy board games, but want something with relatively simple interactions and a more freestyle gameplay.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game takes a different amount of time depending on which win conditions are considered, and what size N was chosen for the board size. For quick games (<5 minutes), I reccomend using board sizes of 4<N<8, and/or using the mercy rule.
